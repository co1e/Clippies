# Clippies
I was a big fan of PasteBot at the time (made by Tapbots) but there was a few things that didn't suit my preferred methods of doing things. 
I attempted to make my own pasteboard manager that I could use to store clipboard history and sync it to my Mac. It used some of the new (at the time) features of the iOS SDK.
